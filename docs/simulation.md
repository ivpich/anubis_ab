# Simulation

Use simulations to understand the statistical properties of your testing pipeline.

* `run_synthetic_experiments` — creates many random A/B splits to measure the distribution of p-values under a specified effect.
* `print_estimated_errors` — summarises type I/II error rates from the simulations.

These helpers are handy when validating experiment design or custom metrics.
