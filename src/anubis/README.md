The `anubis` package is split into several modules:

- `preprocessing` – data cleaning utilities
- `power` – power and sample size calculations
- `tests` – statistical test wrappers
- `stratification` – functions for building balanced cohorts
- `cuped` – CUPED variance reduction
- `simulation` – tools for running synthetic experiments

Each module exposes documented functions. Refer to the markdown files in `../../docs` for further explanation.
