# Anubis

Anubis is a lightweight toolkit for running A/B tests. It includes helpers for power analysis, statistical tests, stratified sampling and CUPED variance reduction. Example notebooks demonstrating usage live in the `notebooks/` folder.

It grew from a research notebook and now provides a small set of well structured modules with documentation and live examples.

## Project structure

- `src/anubis/` – library code organised by topic (preprocessing, power calculations, hypothesis tests, stratification, CUPED and simulations).
- `docs/` – Markdown guides explaining the purpose and formulas behind each module.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter examples showing how to use the library.

Install the package in editable mode and explore the notebooks to see typical workflows.
