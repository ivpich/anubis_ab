# Anubis

Anubis is a lightweight toolkit for designing and analysing A/B experiments.
It grew from a research notebook and now provides a small set of well
structured modules with documentation and live examples.

## Project structure

- `src/anubis/` – library code organised by topic (preprocessing, power
  calculations, hypothesis tests, stratification, CUPED and simulations).
- `docs/` – Markdown guides explaining the purpose and formulas behind each
  module.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter examples showing how to use the library.

Install the package in editable mode and explore the notebooks to see typical
workflows.
